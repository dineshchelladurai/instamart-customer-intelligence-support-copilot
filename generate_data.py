If a completed order is delivered in more than 45 minutes, the customer receives a full refund of the order amount. If a completed order is delivered in 45 minutes or less, no late-delivery refund is paid. Refunds up to INR 1000 are approved automatically by the support system. A refund above INR 1000 must be approved by a human support lead before money is returned. Approved refunds are credited to the original payment method within 5 working days. A refund request must be raised within 7 days of the delivery date.",

The supported cities are Chennai, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Delhi, Hyderabad and Pune. A delivery fee of INR 25 is charged on orders below INR 199, and delivery is free on orders of INR 199 or more. During heavy rain the promised time may extend to 60 minutes and the app shows a rain notice. A rider will attempt to contact the customer twice before marking an order as undeliverable. Electronics items are delivered only after the customer shares a one time password with the rider.",

If a payment fails but money is deducted, the amount is returned automatically within 48 hours. A customer who sees two charges for one order should raise a billing ticket with the order identifier. Wallet balance can be used for any order and is never refunded as cash. Coupons cannot be combined with wallet balance on the same order.",
    "privacy_policy.txt": "Privacy Policy. Customer phone numbers and email addresses are used only for order updates and support. Support tickets are processed with personal details masked before any automated tool reads them. Delivery addresses are deleted from active systems 180 days after the last order. A customer can ask for account deletion and the request is completed within 30 days. Payment card numbers are never stored by the support system.",
